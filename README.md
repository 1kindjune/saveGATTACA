DNA imaging
===========

Takes text files that convert the string of DNA into a visual colored version of DNA. It will allow each user to login and pull up all the DNAs they have saved. Each DNA strand can be labeled and can find the number of times a specific sequence of DNA is found on that particular DNA.

Module/Research
---------------
-~~MVC: Separates logic from rest of user face, made up of model, view and controller. The model will handle the data in the app with access to the database, the view will render the info on the screen and controller sends commands to model to update its state, etc.~~

-CSS preprocesser (sass, less, myth) :It is a scripting language that extends css and it gets compied into regular css syntax. It has benefits such as simpler/cleaner code, more flexible, libraries, etc. 

-use of JSHint: It is a static code analysis tool used to check if the JS code compileswith coding rules. It will not try to run the code to check for syntax errors from running. It can enforce style guides and helps you to become more consistent/readable code. 

-~~User authentication: Checks whether the user is who that they declare to be using passwords as verification. Using this to allow user to bring up saved DNA they have created before.~~

-~~client side form validation: It displays the errors focusing on the field that is incorrect one by one. Client side form validation is a fast form of validation where an allarm is triggered on submission of form. It can help make sure that the user correctly fills in all the details.~~ 

-CSS framework (not just bootstrap, foundation): It is a pre-pared software framework meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant webdesign using CSS. Some benefits include that they provide code that you dont need to write from scratch over again and again, help cross browser problems, encourage grid based design, come with documentation.

-Visual effects: Visual effects like fading, blinking will help make the website overall more user friendly and visualy simulating.

-~~client side templating: It consists of removing the job of rendering on the back end and adding the job to the client using JS. This allows for faster web apps and more control. It is a greate way to separate markup and logic and maximizes code reusability.~~
